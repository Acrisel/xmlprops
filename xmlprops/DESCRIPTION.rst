projenv provides mechanism for project to manage parameters for programs in hierarchical way.

Projects can use Environ xml files to define parameters in any package node.  
Then, in programs, environment can be loaded and used as Environ dictionary.

os.environ can be also used when parameters are defined as exported to the environment.

projenv mechanism supports override of environment values in package hierarcy starting from 
project root folder to the node evaluated.
